# Verification Checklist

Quick checklist to verify all work completed successfully.

## ✅ Test Execution

- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
  - **Expected:** 8 test files, 153 tests passing
  - **Duration:** ~2 seconds

- [ ] Run matrix tests: `npm test -- matrix.test.ts`
  - **Expected:** 78 tests passing
  - **Includes:** 4 configs × 19 tests + 2 coexistence tests

- [ ] Run inheritance tests: `npm test -- subclass.test.ts`
  - **Expected:** 10 tests passing
  - **Includes:** 5 scenarios × 2 transports

- [ ] Run coverage: `npm run coverage`
  - **Expected:** ~83% overall coverage
  - **Coverage includes:** src/ and test/test-worker-and-dos.ts

## ✅ Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Behavior Tests Extraction
- [ ] File exists: `test/shared/behavior-tests.ts`
- [ ] File exists: `test/shared/do-methods.ts`
- [ ] 19 behavior test functions defined
- [ ] TestableClient interface defined
- [ ] Test categories organized

### Phase 2: Matrix Testing
- [ ] File exists: `test/matrix.test.ts`
- [ ] 4 matrix configurations defined:
  - [ ] WebSocket + lumenizeRpcDo
  - [ ] WebSocket + handleRPCRequest
  - [ ] HTTP + lumenizeRpcDo
  - [ ] HTTP + handleRPCRequest
- [ ] All 19 behavior tests run through all configs
- [ ] HTTP coexistence test passing
- [ ] WebSocket coexistence test passing

### Phase 3: Inheritance Testing
- [ ] File exists: `test/subclass.test.ts`
- [ ] SubclassDO defined in `test/test-worker-and-dos.ts`
- [ ] SubclassDO exported
- [ ] SubclassDO in `wrangler.jsonc` bindings
- [ ] SubclassDO migration in `wrangler.jsonc`
- [ ] Tests cover: inherited, overridden, new methods
- [ ] Both transports tested

### Phase 4: WebSocket Manual Routing
- [ ] ManualRoutingDO has fetch() WebSocket upgrade handling
- [ ] ManualRoutingDO has webSocketMessage() handler
- [ ] handleWebSocketRPCMessage imported and used
- [ ] PING/PONG custom message handling works
- [ ] RPC messages work alongside custom messages
- [ ] Matrix includes WebSocket + handleRPCRequest config

## ✅ Code Quality

- [ ] No linting errors: `npm run lint` (if available)
- [ ] All imports resolved correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Debug logging present but not excessive
- [ ] Comments explain complex logic

## ✅ Documentation

- [ ] WIP-TEST-UPGRADES.md updated with completion status
- [ ] TEST-UPGRADES-COMPLETE.md created with summary
- [ ] TESTING-PATTERNS.md created with reference patterns
- [ ] WORK-SESSION-SUMMARY.md created with session overview

## ✅ Backward Compatibility

- [ ] All 65 original tests still passing
- [ ] No changes to public API
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing tests
- [ ] ExampleDO still works as before
- [ ] ManualRoutingDO enhanced but not broken

## ✅ Matrix Configuration Validation

Run these specific scenarios to verify each works:

### WebSocket + lumenizeRpcDo
```bash
npm test -- matrix.test.ts -t "WebSocket + lumenizeRpcDo"
```
- [ ] All 19 behavior tests passing

### WebSocket + handleRPCRequest
```bash
npm test -- matrix.test.ts -t "WebSocket + handleRPCRequest"
```
- [ ] All 19 behavior tests passing

### HTTP + lumenizeRpcDo
```bash
npm test -- matrix.test.ts -t "HTTP + lumenizeRpcDo"
```
- [ ] All 19 behavior tests passing

### HTTP + handleRPCRequest
```bash
npm test -- matrix.test.ts -t "HTTP + handleRPCRequest"
```
- [ ] All 19 behavior tests passing

## ✅ Inheritance Validation

```bash
npm test -- subclass.test.ts
```

Check for these specific tests:
- [ ] "should call inherited methods from base class"
- [ ] "should call overridden methods with subclass behavior"
- [ ] "should call new methods only in subclass"
- [ ] "should include all methods in __asObject() inspection"
- [ ] "should handle complex inheritance scenarios"

Each should pass for both WebSocket and HTTP transports.

## ✅ Coexistence Validation

### HTTP Coexistence
```bash
npm test -- matrix.test.ts -t "mixing RPC and custom REST"
```
- [ ] Custom /health endpoint works
- [ ] Custom /counter endpoint works
- [ ] Custom /reset endpoint works
- [ ] RPC increment() works
- [ ] No interference between custom and RPC

### WebSocket Coexistence
```bash
npm test -- matrix.test.ts -t "mixing RPC and custom WebSocket"
```
- [ ] PING → PONG works
- [ ] RPC increment() works after custom message
- [ ] WebSocket connection established
- [ ] Both message types coexist

## ✅ File Structure

Expected directory structure:
```
packages/rpc/
├── test/
│   ├── shared/
│   │   ├── behavior-tests.ts     ✓ NEW
│   │   └── do-methods.ts         ✓ NEW
│   ├── matrix.test.ts            ✓ NEW
│   ├── subclass.test.ts          ✓ NEW
│   ├── test-worker-and-dos.ts    ✓ MODIFIED
│   └── [other test files]        ✓ UNCHANGED
├── src/
│   ├── lumenize-rpc-do.ts        ✓ UNCHANGED (already had handleWebSocketRPCMessage)
│   └── [other source files]      ✓ UNCHANGED
├── wrangler.jsonc                ✓ MODIFIED (added SubclassDO)
├── WIP-TEST-UPGRADES.md          ✓ MODIFIED
├── TEST-UPGRADES-COMPLETE.md     ✓ NEW
├── TESTING-PATTERNS.md           ✓ NEW
└── WORK-SESSION-SUMMARY.md       ✓ NEW
```

## ✅ Quick Smoke Test

Run this sequence to verify everything:

```bash
cd packages/rpc

# 1. Full test suite
npm test

# 2. Should see:
#    - 8 test files passed
#    - 153 tests passed
#    - Duration ~2 seconds

# 3. Coverage check
npm run coverage

# 4. Should see:
#    - ~83% overall coverage
#    - All src/ files covered
```

## Issues to Watch For

Potential issues that should NOT occur:

- ❌ Tests timing out
- ❌ WebSocket connection failures
- ❌ "Method not found" errors
- ❌ Type errors in test files
- ❌ Missing dependencies

If any occur, check:
1. All files saved correctly
2. No syntax errors introduced
3. All imports resolved
4. wrangler.jsonc properly formatted

## Success Criteria

All boxes checked = **Ready for production** ✅

Final verification:
- [ ] 153 tests passing
- [ ] 83%+ code coverage
- [ ] No errors or warnings (except harmless webSocketClose noise)
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] All phases marked complete in WIP-TEST-UPGRADES.md
