# Phase 2 Complete: Merged __asObject Tests

## Summary

✅ **Deleted object-inspection.test.ts** (2 tests)
✅ **All 102 tests passing**
✅ **__asObject already covered** in matrix (4 configs) + subclass (2 transports) = 6 comprehensive tests

## Discovery

The `__asObject()` feature was **already fully tested** in the matrix and subclass tests:

### Matrix Coverage (4 tests):
1. WebSocket + lumenizeRpcDo → asObject ✅
2. WebSocket + handleRPCRequest → asObject ✅  
3. HTTP + lumenizeRpcDo → asObject ✅
4. HTTP + handleRPCRequest → asObject ✅

### Subclass Coverage (2 tests):
1. WebSocket transport → asObject with inheritance ✅
2. HTTP transport → asObject with inheritance ✅

### Total: 6 comprehensive __asObject tests

The standalone `object-inspection.test.ts` only had 2 tests (WebSocket + HTTP), which were **complete duplicates** of the matrix tests.

## Final Test Count

### After Phase 2:
- **Standalone tests**: 9 tests across 3 files
- **Matrix tests**: 78 tests (includes 4 __asObject tests)
- **Subclass tests**: 10 tests (includes 2 __asObject tests)
- **Total**: 102 tests passing

### Reduction from Phase 1: 104 → 102 (2 more tests removed)
### Total reduction: 153 → 102 (51 tests removed, 33% reduction)

## Remaining Standalone Test Files

### 1. error-serialization.test.ts (7 tests)
- **Purpose**: Unit tests for internal serialization functions
- **Status**: KEEP - agreed to keep as standalone unit tests

### 2. client.test.ts (3 tests)
- **Purpose**: HTTP-specific baseline and edge cases
- **Status**: KEEP for now, but coverage dropped 20%
- **Tests**:
  1. Simple RPC baseline
  2. Custom configuration (timeout, headers) - **Not fully exercised**
  3. DO internal routing preservation

### 3. lumenize-rpc-do.test.ts (4 tests)
- **Purpose**: Server-side validation and internals
- **Status**: KEEP - unit-level testing
- **Tests**:
  1. Arrays with functions (#preprocessResult)
  2. 405 for non-POST requests
  3. maxDepth limit (50)
  4. maxArgs limit (100)

### 4. websocket-integration.test.ts (1 test)
- **Purpose**: WebSocket edge cases
- **Status**: KEEP for now
- **Tests**:
  1. Explicit disconnect error handling

### Files DELETED:
- ❌ manual-routing.test.ts (Phase 1)
- ❌ object-inspection.test.ts (Phase 2)

## Coverage Analysis

The 20% drop in `client.ts` coverage is concerning. Let me investigate...

Looking at the uncovered lines:
- Lines 362-363, 375-388: These are in Proxy trap handlers
- The issue: Coverage tools struggle with Proxy internals

The **custom config test** passes `timeout` and `headers` but doesn't verify they're actually used. The matrix tests use default config values, so those config properties never get exercised.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep custom config test and enhance it
- Actually verify timeout works (make a slow call, verify it times out)
- Verify headers are passed (check in DO that headers exist)

### Option 2: Add custom config as matrix variation
- Add a 5th matrix config that uses custom timeout/headers
- Would test across both transports

### Option 3: Accept coverage drop
- The custom config code paths are simple (just pass-through)
- Low risk if not fully covered
- Delete the custom config test

### WebSocket disconnect test
Could potentially be merged into matrix WebSocket tests, but it's a specific edge case that may warrant standalone testing.

## Next Steps?

1. ✅ Merged __asObject into matrix (already there, deleted duplicates)
2. ⏸️ Address client.ts coverage drop?
   - Enhance custom config test?
   - Add to matrix?
   - Delete and accept coverage drop?
3. ⏸️ Review remaining standalone tests?
4. ⏸️ Pare down test-worker-and-dos.ts using coverage report (original request)?
