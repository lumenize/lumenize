  // The next set of tests will simulate a WebSocket upgrade over HTTP.
  // You get the actual WebSocket that the Worker would see as well as proper input gates behavior.
  // This is the general approach that the Cloudflare agents team uses.
  //
  // It has a few advantages over the mocking approach we show later that derive from the
  // fact that it's going through the actual Worker fetch upgrade process:
  //   - You can test that your setWebSocketAutoResponse pair works
  //   - You can test the WebSocket sub-protcol selection code in your Worker
  //   - You can test origin rejection that's in your Worker
  //   - Input gates work
  // 
  // However, there are significant limitations of this approach:
  //   - You cannot inspect the DO storage
  //   - You cannot use a client like AgentClient that calls the browser's WebSocket API 
  //   - You cannot inspect connection tags or attachments in your tests
  //   - It's not a drop-in replacement for runInDurableObject
  //   - When you write your Worker, you cannot use url.protocol to make the routing determination
  //     because fetch won't allow it. So, your Worker must route regular HTTP GET calls to the 
  //     Durable Object some other way.
  //   - You cannot inspect the server-side close code in addition to the client-side one
  
  // TODO:
  //   - You cannot test multiple simultaneous WS connections to the same instance
