feat(rpc): Complete test suite upgrade with matrix testing and inheritance support

BREAKING: None (100% backward compatible)

This commit completes a comprehensive test suite upgrade from 65 to 153 tests,
introducing matrix testing, inheritance testing, and full WebSocket support for
manual routing.

Changes:
- Add matrix testing infrastructure (78 tests across 4 transport/instrumentation configs)
- Add inheritance testing with SubclassDO (10 tests across 2 transports)
- Enable WebSocket support for ManualRoutingDO (handleWebSocketRPCMessage)
- Add custom handler coexistence tests (HTTP and WebSocket)
- Extract 19 reusable behavior tests
- Improve code coverage from ~75% to 83.28%

New files:
- test/shared/behavior-tests.ts - Reusable test functions
- test/shared/do-methods.ts - Shared DO implementations
- test/matrix.test.ts - Matrix testing infrastructure (78 tests)
- test/subclass.test.ts - Inheritance testing (10 tests)
- Documentation: 5 reference documents

Modified files:
- test/test-worker-and-dos.ts - Add SubclassDO, enhance ManualRoutingDO
- wrangler.jsonc - Add SubclassDO binding

Test results:
- Total: 153 tests (up from 65, +135%)
- Matrix: 78 tests (4 configs Ã— 19 behaviors + 2 coexistence)
- Inheritance: 10 tests (5 scenarios Ã— 2 transports)
- All passing, ~2 second execution time
- Coverage: 83.28% overall

## Option 2: Multiple Commits (Granular)

### Commit 1: Phase 1 - Extract Behavior Tests
```
feat(rpc): Extract reusable behavior tests

Extract core RPC behavior tests into reusable functions to enable
systematic testing across multiple configurations.

- Add test/shared/behavior-tests.ts with 19 test functions
- Add test/shared/do-methods.ts with shared implementations
- Define TestableClient interface for consistent testing
- Organize tests into 8 categories (basic, errors, objects, etc.)
- Maintain backward compatibility (all 65 original tests still pass)

Part 1 of 4 in test suite upgrade.
```

### Commit 2: Phase 2 - Matrix Testing Infrastructure
```
feat(rpc): Add matrix testing infrastructure

Implement matrix testing pattern to run all behavior tests through
multiple transport and instrumentation combinations.

- Add test/matrix.test.ts with 78 tests
- Test 4 configurations: WebSocket/HTTP Ã— lumenizeRpcDo/handleRPCRequest
- Add HTTP custom handler coexistence test
- Enhance ManualRoutingDO with all ExampleDO methods
- Each of 19 behavior tests now runs through all viable configs

Part 2 of 4 in test suite upgrade.
Tests: 65 original + 78 matrix = 143 total
```

### Commit 3: Phase 3 - Inheritance Testing
```
feat(rpc): Add inheritance testing with SubclassDO

Verify RPC works correctly through class inheritance with comprehensive
tests covering inherited, overridden, and new methods.

- Add SubclassDO extending ExampleDO in test-worker-and-dos.ts
  - New methods: multiply(), doubleIncrement(), getSubclassProperty()
  - Overridden: increment() and add() with bonuses
  - Getter: subclassName
- Add test/subclass.test.ts with 10 tests (5 scenarios Ã— 2 transports)
- Add SubclassDO binding to wrangler.jsonc
- Test __asObject() includes all methods from inheritance chain

Part 3 of 4 in test suite upgrade.
Tests: 143 + 10 inheritance = 153 total
```

### Commit 4: Phase 4 - WebSocket Manual Routing
```
feat(rpc): Enable WebSocket support for ManualRoutingDO

Complete manual routing support by adding WebSocket upgrade handling
and message routing to ManualRoutingDO.

- Add WebSocket upgrade handling to ManualRoutingDO.fetch()
- Add ManualRoutingDO.webSocketMessage() handler
  - Custom message handling (PING/PONG)
  - RPC handling via handleWebSocketRPCMessage()
- Add WebSocket coexistence test
- Enable WebSocket + handleRPCRequest matrix configuration

Part 4 of 4 in test suite upgrade.
Matrix tests: 58 â†’ 78 (now all 4 configs working)
Total tests: 153, Coverage: 83.28%
```

### Commit 5: Documentation

Add reference documentation for the test upgrade project and
new testing patterns.

Documentation added:
- WIP-TEST-UPGRADES.md - Project plan and tracking
- TEST-UPGRADES-COMPLETE.md - Completion summary

## Recommended Approach

For clean git history, I recommend **Option 2 (Multiple Commits)** because:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to review each phase
- Easy to revert if needed
- Good documentation of thought process

For quick merging, use **Option 3 (Squash and Merge)** with the PR stats.
