## PartyKit lineage

Cloudflare's `agents` npm package is built on top of [PartyKit](https://partykit.io/). This isn't just historical trivia — the PartyKit heritage still leaks through in the form of headers, identifiers, and error messages. See [this Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/1344688586146189475/1469422052376187053) for examples.
