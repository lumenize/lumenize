# Introduction to Lumenize RPC

Lumenize RPC provides de✨light✨ful remote procedure calls to Cloudflare Durable Objects over HTTP or WebSocket transports.

Lumenize RPC supports two main use cases:
1. In-process integration testing (documented in [`@lumenize/testing` Usage](/docs/testing/usage))
2. In-production RPC (documented in this section)
   
## In-production RPC

1. **Purpose**: Interact with your Durable Objects from a browser client as if running inside the DO.

2. **Supports**:
   - Any StructuredCloneable type (e.g., `Set`, `Map`, `Date`, circular objects)
   - Automatic propagation of errors thrown by your DO back to the client
   - Both HTTP and WebSocket transports

3. **Secure**:
   - Security hooks and best-practice examples included

4. **Example Usage**:
   ```typescript
   // Store a value in the DO's storage
   await client.ctx.storage.put('count', '10');
   // Call an RPC method defined in your DO
   const currentCount = await client.increment(); // returns 11
   ```

## WebSocket vs HTTP

Both transports offer identical RPC functionality but have different performance characteristics.

### WebSocket (default)
- Persistent connection for multiple RPC calls
- Higher initial connection overhead
- Lower latency for subsequent calls
- Automatic connection management
- Automatically re-establishes connection on demand
- Utilizes Cloudflare DurableObject's hibernating WebSockets

### HTTP
- One HTTP request per RPC call
- Simpler
- Slightly higher per-call latency

Choose based on your requirements:
- **When in doubt**: WebSocket is generally more efficient and low-latency
- **Production scenarios with restrictive intermediaries**: HTTP may be more robust
- **Future-proofing**: `@lumenize/mesh` builds on WebSockets for real-time state sync — your client code will remain the same
