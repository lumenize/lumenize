# Comparsison to Cap'n Web

We were days away from releasing `@lumenize/rpc` and `@lumenize/testing` when Cloudflare 
released Cap'n Web (Cloudflare's own last-mile RPC built under the leadership of the 
father of Durable Objects, Kenton Varga). We went ahead and released 
`@lumenize/testing` with full documentation as planned because it had been promised
to the community and we soft-released `@lumenize/rpc` because 
`@lumenize/testing` depends upon it, but with almost no docs and those said that
we were holding off on recommending it until we'd had a chance to do a deep dive
comparison between the two.

At the time, we were thinking of several possibilities:
1. Cap'n Web would be everything we'd hoped it would be and we'd port all of Lumenize
   (including `@lumenize/testing`) over to it.
2. We'd continue using Lumenize RPC internally and maintaining it, but not strongly
   recommend it, or at least say when to choose which.
3. Lumenize RPC would hold up well in comparison, and we'd be able to strongly recommend
   it.

We're happy to say that today we are delivering that deep dive analysis and are making
a strong recommendation for it.

## High Level Comparison

### Similarities

- Both magically make it feel like you are working with local resources.
- Both are new, but based upon signficant legacy. The first versions of Lumenize running 
  on Azure go back over a decade. Cap'n Web was built with learning from and designed
  to feel like Workers RPC even if it shares little, if anything, in terms of code.
- They also have some architectural similarities:
  - They do their magic using a thenable `Proxy`
  - Both clients run anywhere JavaScript runs
- They have essentially the same perceived performance which is driven almost entirely by 
  minimizing round trips. We couldn't find a single pattern where their round trip counts
  differed.

### Differences

- Cap'n Web's server side is designed to run anywhere JavaScript is run, while Lumenize
  RPC server-side only runs in Cloudflare
- Cap'n Web supports plugging in your own transport layer. While Lumenize RPC has a
  documented interface for its transport layers and provides HTTP and WebSockets 
  transports, they are configuration options, not injectable at this point in time.
- Lumenize RPC's default transport layer uses DurableObjects hibernating WebSockets.
  Cap'n Web uses non-hibernating WebSockets even when running on DurableObjects.
- Lumenize RPC provides seemless access to ctx (including storage) and env, even allowing 
  you to use env to hop from the RPC host to another DO (e.g. `client.env.DO_BINDING.getByName('instance-name').someMethod()`) just works. Cap'n Web doesn't allow this.
- Lumenize RPC supports every type that Workers RPC supports (Set, Map, objects with 
  cycles and aliases, etc.) except Readable/Writable Stream. Type support in Cap'n
  Web is very limited in comparison.
