# CORS Support for Request Routing

The `routeDORequest` function includes comprehensive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support, allowing you to control which origins can access your Durable Objects.

## Overview

When CORS is enabled and an origin is allowed:
- Sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin>` (reflects the request's origin)
- Sets `Vary: Origin` header
- Does NOT set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` (not supported)

### HTTP vs WebSocket CORS Behavior

**Critical Difference**: This implementation uses **non-standard server-side CORS enforcement** that differs from typical CORS implementations (like Cloudflare's `routeAgentRequest`).

#### Standard CORS Behavior (Other Implementations)
Most CORS implementations (including `routeAgentRequest` from the Cloudflare `agents` package) follow the standard browser-enforced pattern:
- **Server forwards ALL requests** to the backend, regardless of origin
- Server adds (or omits) CORS headers in the response
- **Browser enforces blocking** - prevents JavaScript from accessing the response if headers don't match
- Backend processes every request, even from disallowed origins

**Problem**: The backend (Durable Object) still processes requests from unwanted origins, wasting resources and potentially exposing it to attacks.

#### Non-Standard (Enhanced) Behavior - This Implementation

This implementation provides **server-side rejection** for both HTTP and WebSocket requests:

**HTTP Requests (GET, POST, etc.)**
- Server validates origin BEFORE forwarding to Durable Object
- **Returns 403 Forbidden** for disallowed origins (request never reaches DO)
  - Note: The browser performs CORS checks on 403 responses (per WHATWG Fetch spec)
  - Since the 403 lacks CORS headers, the browser treats it as a CORS failure (network error)
  - JavaScript sees the same error as standard CORS violation - no difference from the browser's perspective
- Only forwards allowed requests to Durable Object
- Adds CORS headers to allowed responses

**WebSocket Upgrade Requests**
- **Browsers DO NOT enforce** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for WebSocket upgrades ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API))
- **Server MUST enforce** origin validation (WebSocket spec delegates security to server)
- **Returns 403 Forbidden** for disallowed origins BEFORE upgrading connection
- Only upgrades to WebSocket if origin is allowed (or CORS is disabled)

#### Why Non-Standard is Better

**Benefits:**
1. **Defence in depth**: Reduces the possibility that a CORS invalid request can change the state of the server in the face of misconfigured SameSite or CSP
2. **Reduced latency**: No round-trip to Durable Object for blocked requests
3. **Cost savings**: Fewer DO invocations and CPU time
4. **Consistency**: Same behavior for regular HTTP and WebSockets upgrade requests
5. **Clearer logs**: By rejecting on the server with a 403, we get a log of the CORS miss

**Browser Compatibility:**
The 403 response appears identical to standard CORS from the browser's perspective:
- Browser sees network-level failure (can't access response)
- JavaScript gets same error as standard CORS violation
- Developer console shows similar CORS error message

#### Comparison:

**Standard CORS (routeAgentRequest from cloudflare/agents)**
1. Request arrives with Origin: https://evil.com
2. Server forwards to Durable Object
3. DO processes request (wastes resources and potentially changes state)
4. Server omits CORS headers
5. Browser blocks response from reaching client-side JavaScript
6. **PROBLEM: DO still did the work!**

**Non‑standard (this implementation)**
1. Request arrives with Origin: https://evil.com
2. Server validates origin, sees it's not allowed
3. Returns 403 Forbidden immediately
4. DO never invoked (resources saved and state unaffected)
5. Browser sees network error (same as CORS failure)
6. **BENEFIT: DO protected, resources saved, browser behavior preserved!**

**Use `onBeforeRequest` if you want the traditional behavior**: If you need traditional browser-only CORS enforcement (or any other custom CORS behavior), you can implement it in the [`onBeforeRequest` hook](/docs/utils/route-do-request#onbeforerequest). This gives you complete control - you can immediately forward to the DO and add CORS headers to the DO's response before returning it to the caller. See [Custom CORS with Hooks](#custom-cors-with-hooks) below.

### Configuration Modes

The `cors` option supports four modes:

- **`false`** (default): No CORS headers are added--responses to cross-origin requests will be hidden by browser from the client-side code
- **`true`** (permissive): Reflects any request's Origin header
- **`{ origin: string[] }`**: Whitelist of allowed origins
- **`{ origin: (origin: string, request: Request) => boolean }`**: Custom validation function

## Usage

### Permissive Mode (Allow All Origins)

```typescript
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: true
});
```

### Whitelist Specific Origins

```typescript
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: {
    origin: ['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com']
  }
});
```

### Custom Validation Function

```typescript
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: {
    origin: (origin, request) => {
      // Check origin domain
      if (!origin.endsWith('.bad-guys.com')) {
        return false;
      }
      
      // Also inspect the request for additional validation
      const apiKey = request.headers.get('X-API-Key');
      if (!apiKey || apiKey !== 'trusted-key') {
        return false;
      }
      
      // Block certain HTTP methods
      if (request.method === 'DELETE') {
        return false;
      }
      
      // Check user agent to block bots
      const userAgent = request.headers.get('User-Agent');
      if (userAgent?.toLowerCase().includes('bot')) {
        return false;
      }
      
      return true;
    }
  }
});
```

The validator function receives both the `origin` string and the full `Request` object, allowing you to implement sophisticated CORS policies based on multiple request attributes.

## Preflight Request Handling

CORS automatically handles OPTIONS (preflight) requests:

- **When origin is allowed**: Returns `204 No Content` with CORS headers (short-circuits before hooks)
- **When origin not allowed** (array/validator modes): Returns `403 Forbidden` without CORS headers
- **When no Origin header present**: Falls through to origin rejection check, then to Durable Object if no rejection

### Example preflight flows

**Allowed origin**
1. Browser sends: OPTIONS /my-do/instance with Origin: https://app.example.com
2. Server validates origin, sees it's allowed
3. Returns 204 No Content with CORS headers immediately

**Disallowed origin (array/validator modes)**
1. Browser sends: OPTIONS /my-do/instance with Origin: https://evil.com
2. Server validates origin, sees it's not allowed
3. Returns 403 Forbidden without CORS headers (browser sees CORS failure)

**No Origin header (same-origin request)**
1. Browser sends: OPTIONS /my-do/instance (no Origin header)
2. No CORS validation occurs
3. Forwards to DO (DO handles the OPTIONS request)

## Integration with Hooks

When CORS is enabled (not `false`), CORS headers are automatically added to responses from:
- The Durable Object itself
- Response object returned by `onBeforeConnect` hook
- Response object returned by `onBeforeRequest` hook

Headers are only added when the origin is allowed:

```typescript
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: { origin: ['https://app.example.com'] },
  onBeforeRequest: async (request, context) => {
    const token = request.headers.get('Authorization');
    if (!token) {
      return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
      // CORS headers will be added to this 401 response if origin is allowed
    }
  }
});
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### Multi-Factor CORS Validation

The function validator's access to the full `Request` object enables sophisticated CORS policies:

```typescript
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: {
    origin: (origin, request) => {
      // 1. Check origin whitelist
      const trustedOrigins = ['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com'];
      const trustedDomains = ['.example.com', '.example.dev'];
      
      const isOriginTrusted = 
        trustedOrigins.includes(origin) ||
        trustedDomains.some(domain => origin.endsWith(domain));
      
      if (!isOriginTrusted) return false;
      
      // 2. Additional request-based checks
      
      // Check authentication token for sensitive operations
      if (request.method !== 'GET') {
        const authToken = request.headers.get('Authorization');
        if (!authToken?.startsWith('Bearer ')) return false;
      }
      
      // Block known bad user agents
      const userAgent = request.headers.get('User-Agent') || '';
      const blockedAgents = ['badbot', 'scraper'];
      if (blockedAgents.some(agent => userAgent.toLowerCase().includes(agent))) {
        return false;
      }
      
      // Rate limiting hint - check for rate limit headers
      const rateLimitRemaining = request.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining');
      if (rateLimitRemaining && parseInt(rateLimitRemaining) === 0) {
        return false;
      }
      
      return true;
    }
  }
});
```

### Custom CORS with Hooks

For complete control over CORS behavior (including traditional browser-only enforcement), use the `onBeforeRequest` hook to manually call the DO and add CORS headers:

```typescript
import { getDOStub } from '@lumenize/utils';
//...

await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  // Disable built-in CORS
  cors: false,
  
  onBeforeRequest: async (request, context) => {
    const origin = request.headers.get('Origin');
    const allowedOrigins = ['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com'];
    
    // Handle preflight
    if (request.method === 'OPTIONS') {
      if (origin && allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
        return new Response(null, {
          status: 204,
          headers: {
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
            'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
            'Vary': 'Origin'
          }
        });
      }
      // Let DO handle unallowed preflight
      return undefined;
    }
    
    // For traditional CORS: call DO manually and add headers based on origin
    const doStub = getDOStub(context.doNamespace, context.doInstanceNameOrId);
    const response = await doStub.fetch(request);
    
    // Add CORS headers if origin is allowed
    if (origin && allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      const headers = new Headers(response.headers);
      headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
      headers.set('Vary', 'Origin');
      
      return new Response(response.body, {
        status: response.status,
        statusText: response.statusText,
        headers
      });
    }
    
    // Return response without CORS headers for unallowed origins
    return response;
  }
});
```

For more information about the functions used above, see:
- [Request Routing](/docs/utils/route-do-request) - Main `routeDORequest` documentation
- [API Reference - routeDORequest](/docs/utils/api/functions/routeDORequest)
- [API Reference - getDOStub](/docs/utils/api/functions/getDOStub)

This approach gives you complete flexibility:
- **Traditional CORS**: Forward all requests to DO, add/omit headers based on origin (DO always processes the request)
- **Custom validation**: Check any request properties before forwarding
- **Direct DO access**: Use `context.doNamespace` and `context.doInstanceNameOrId` to call the DO yourself
- **Custom responses**: Return any response from the hook, which short-circuits the normal call to the DO—useful because you already performed the action inside the hook

## Security Considerations

**CORS was never a security mechanism.** Think of CORS like a "No Trespassing" sign — it only works if the visitor respects it. This non-standard implementation adds a short fence to go with the sign. An attacker can easily step over this fence, but accidental trespassing becomes less likely, and when unwanted requests do occur, you'll waste fewer resources. **CORS is not a substitute for proper authentication and authorization** - always validate API keys, tokens, or other credentials for sensitive operations.

1. **Browser-only**: While this implementation provides server-side rejection (better than standard CORS), it only helps with browser initiated requests. Malicious non-browser clients can set any `Origin` header they want, bypassing origin validation entirely.

2. **No credentials support**: This implementation does not set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, meaning cookies and authorization headers won't be sent cross-origin even if the origin is allowed.

3. **Origin validation**: Always validates the Origin header when CORS is enabled - never allows requests without proper origin validation in whitelist/function modes.

4. **Vary header**: Always sets `Vary: Origin` to ensure proper caching behavior with CDNs and browsers.
