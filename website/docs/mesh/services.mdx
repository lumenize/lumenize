# Services (`this.svc`)

LumenizeDO provides automatic dependency injection via `this.svc`. Services are type-safe, lazily initialized, and available throughout your DO methods.

## Built-in Services

These are always available on any LumenizeDO subclass:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`this.svc.sql`](./sql) | SQL template literal for DO storage |
| [`this.svc.alarms`](./alarms) | Alarm scheduling with continuations |

## Plugin Services

Install optional packages to add more services:

| Package | Service | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [`@lumenize/fetch`](/docs/fetch) | `this.svc.fetch` | Proxy fetch for external HTTP calls |

## Creating Custom Services

You can create your own services using the NADIS plugin system. See [Creating Plugins](./creating-plugins) for details.
