# Introduction

## What is Lumenize?

### Today (October, 2025)
Today, this repo contains a collection of utilities for building and testing scalable/maintainable applications on Cloudflare Durable Objects (DOs). The primary use-cases you can use today center around Lumenize RPC:

1. **In-process integration testing**. More capability and more *de*light*ful* DX than `cloudflare:test`'s runInDurableObjects particularly for testing DOs that implement WebSockets. Supports: `new WebSockets()`, client libraries, test auto response pair, test coverage, etc.

2. **In-production RPC all the way from a browser**. Provides all the capability you need to securly run in production, also, with a *de*light*ful* DX:
  ```typescript
  await client.ctx.storage.kv.put('count', '10');
  const currentCount = await client.increment();  // 11
  ```

### Going Forward

Although not yet released as open source, this is also going to be the home of two other projects: LumenizeBase and Lumenize.

**LumenizeBase** is a modular base class and set of plugins for your DOs with features that differentiate it from Actor, Agent, and McpAgent.

**Lumenize** is the ultimate platform for vibe coding internal enterprise or B2B SaaS applications. It's MCP-first meaning that the only API it exposes is MCP. In other words, your Lumenize applications are ready for agentic AI workflows! It's also the first MCP platform where it is difficult to make it unsecure, as opposed to the other way around.

## *De*light*ful* Developer Experience

### Opinionated Yet Flexible

Lumenize is designed to be opinionated where it matters, providing clear guidance and best practices for building robust scalable applications on DOs. At the same time, it remains flexible wherever that's possible, allowing you to install only the plugins you need, and exposing the same plugin system so you can extend it in the same modular way.

### Shoulders of Giants

Lumenize is the result of taking the best ideas and code from `Agent`, `PartyKit`, `Actor`, and `durable-utils`, adding robustness, and our own unique capabilities. Here is a [blog post that says more about the Lumenize journey](/blog/shoulders-of-giants).

### Engineering Excellence

- 90%+ test coverage with meaningful assertions, not just happy path
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Documentation assured in-sync with code via doc-testing
- Toggle logging by namespace, DO instance, etc.
- Guaranteed rapid bug fixes

## Release Status

Most of what we built is not yet published under an open source license and/or lacked good documentation. However, we are now in a position to start releasing pieces under open source licenses as we clean up the documentation for external consumption. See below for the status of what is out and what's coming out next.
