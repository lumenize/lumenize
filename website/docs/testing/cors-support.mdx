# CORS Support for Request Routing

Lumenize's `routeDORequest` and `routeAgentRequest` functions includes comprehensive CORS 
(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support, allowing you to control which origins can access 
your Durable Objects.

## Overview

When CORS is enabled and an origin is allowed:
- Sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin>` (reflects the request's origin)
- Sets `Vary: Origin` header
- Does NOT set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` (not supported)

### HTTP vs WebSocket CORS Behavior

**Critical Difference**: This implementation uses **non-standard server-side CORS 
enforcement** that differs from typical CORS implementations (like Cloudflare's 
`routeAgentRequest`).

#### Standard CORS Behavior (Other Implementations)
Most CORS implementations (including `routeAgentRequest` from the Cloudflare `agents` 
package) follow the standard browser-enforced pattern:
- **Server forwards ALL requests** to the backend (the DO in this case), regardless of 
  origin
- Server adds (or omits) CORS headers in the response
- **Browser enforces blocking** - prevents JavaScript from accessing the response if 
  headers don't match
- Backend (DO) processes every request, even from disallowed origins

**Problem**: The backend (Durable Object) still processes requests from unwanted origins, 
wasting resources, possibly altering the DO's state, and increasing the risk of exploit.

#### Non-Standard (Enhanced) Behavior - This Implementation

This implementation provides **server-side rejection** to prevent unwanted requests from reaching your Durable Objects when using a allowlist or custom validation function:

**HTTP Requests**
- Server validates origin BEFORE forwarding to DO
- **OPTIONS (preflight) from disallowed origins**: Returns `204` without CORS headers 
  (per CORS spec), browser rejects client-side
- **Non-OPTIONS from disallowed origins**: Returns `403` (browser treats as CORS failure, 
  DO never invoked)
- Only allowed requests reach the DO

**WebSocket Upgrade Requests**
- Browsers don't enforce CORS for WebSockets (
  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)), so server must
- Returns `403` for disallowed origins BEFORE upgrading when using a allowlist or custom 
  validation function
- Only upgrades when origin allowed when using a allowlist or custom validation function

#### Why Server-Side Rejection?

**Benefits vs Standard CORS:**
1. **DO protection**: Disallowed requests never reach your DO (no state changes, no 
   wasted resources, lower risk of exploit)
2. **Cost savings**: Fewer DO invocations and CPU time
3. **Clearer logs**: Server-side rejection creates audit trail
4. **Consistency**: Same behavior for HTTP and WebSocket requests

The browser experience is identical—JavaScript sees network errors for CORS violations 
just like with standard CORS.

### Configuration Modes

The `cors` option supports four modes:

- **`false`** (default): No CORS headers are added. Browser will block cross-origin HTTP 
  requests from reaching the client-side JavaScript but only after the DO is called and 
  the browser has no CORS protection for WebSockets.
- **`true`** (permissive): Reflects any request's Origin header. No protection.
- **`{ origin: string[] }`**: allowlist of allowed origins
- **`{ origin: (origin, request) => boolean }`**: Custom validation function

| Mode | CORS Headers | DO Called | Safety |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **`false`** | ❌ None | ⚠️ Always | ⚠️ Limited |
| **`true`** | ✅ Permissive | ⚠️ Always | ⚠️ Unprotected |
| **allowlist** | ✅ If allowed | ✅ Only allowed | ✅ Protected |
| **validation fn** | ✅ If allowed | ✅ Only allowed | ✅ Protected |

:::warning
With `false` or `true` modes, **all requests reach your Durable Object**, including from disallowed origins. Use allowlist or validation function for protection.
:::

## Usage

### Permissive Mode (Allow All Origins)

This is not recommended, but we've included it to match Cloudflare's `routeAgentRequest`
behavior.

```typescript @check-example('packages/utils/test/unit/route-do-request.test.ts')
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: true
});
```

### allowlist Specific Origins

This is what you should do 90% of the time, especially if you are expecting WebSocket
connections from a browser. This is not supported by Cloudflare's `routeAgentRequest`.

```typescript @check-example('packages/utils/test/unit/route-do-request.test.ts')
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: {
    origin: ['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com']
  }
});
```

### Custom Validation Function

With a custom validation function, you can base your CORS decision on more than just the 
Origin header. The validator receives both `origin` and the full `Request`, enabling 
sophisticated policies based on headers, methods, and more.

```typescript @check-example('packages/utils/test/unit/route-do-request.test.ts')
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: {
    origin: (origin, request) => {
      // Check origin allowlist/patterns
      const trustedOrigins = ['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com'];
      const trustedDomains = ['.example.com', '.example.dev'];
      const isOriginTrusted = 
        trustedOrigins.includes(origin) ||
        trustedDomains.some(domain => origin.endsWith(domain));
      
      if (!isOriginTrusted) return false;
      
      // Additional request-based validation
      const apiKey = request.headers.get('X-API-Key');
      if (!apiKey || apiKey !== 'trusted-key') return false;
      
      // Block sensitive methods without auth
      if (request.method === 'DELETE') {
        const authToken = request.headers.get('Authorization');
        if (!authToken?.startsWith('Bearer ')) return false;
      }
      
      // Block known bad user agents
      const userAgent = request.headers.get('User-Agent') || '';
      if (userAgent.toLowerCase().includes('bot')) return false;
      
      return true;
    }
  }
});
```

## Use `Browser.context(origin)` to test your CORS implementation

So you can test your CORS implementation, the `Browser` class has the ability to simulate
a request or WebSocket upgrade from a particular Origin by using 
`browser.context(origin).fetch()`

### Automatic Preflight

**automatic CORS preflight**:

1. **Detects non-simple requests** (non-GET/HEAD/POST, custom headers, `
   Content-Type: application/json`)
2. **Automatically sends OPTIONS** with `Access-Control-Request-Method` and headers
3. **Validates CORS headers** on preflight and actual responses
4. **Throws `TypeError`** on CORS violations (browser-standard behavior)

```typescript @check-example('packages/testing/test/unit/browser.test.ts')
import { Browser } from '@lumenize/testing';

const browser = new Browser();
const context = browser.context('https://app.example.com');

// Automatically sends preflight before POST (due to application/json)
const response = await context.fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' })
});
// Behind the scenes: OPTIONS → validate → POST → validate → return
```
### `TypeError` simulation

CORS failures throw `TypeError` like browsers do:

```typescript @check-example('packages/testing/test/unit/browser.test.ts')
try {
  await context.fetch('https://api.example.com/data', { 
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ data: 'value' })
  });
} catch (error) {
  // TypeError: Failed to fetch (CORS validation failed)
}
```

## Integration with Hooks

When CORS is enabled (not `false`), CORS headers are automatically added to responses 
from:
- The Durable Object itself
- Response object returned by `onBeforeConnect` hook
- Response object returned by `onBeforeRequest` hook

Headers are only added when the origin is allowed:

```typescript @check-example('packages/utils/test/unit/route-do-request.test.ts')
await routeDORequest(request, env, {
  cors: { origin: ['https://app.example.com'] },
  onBeforeRequest: async (request, context) => {
    const token = request.headers.get('Authorization');
    if (!token) {
      return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
      // CORS headers will be added to this 401 response if origin is allowed
    }
  }
});
```

## Security Considerations

**CORS is not a security mechanism.** It's a "No Trespassing" sign—effective only if 
visitors respect it. This implementation adds server-side rejection as a "short fence," 
reducing accidental access and wasted resources. 
**Always use proper authentication and authorization** for sensitive operations.

**Important notes:**
- **Browser-only protection**: Non-browser clients can set any `Origin` header, bypassing 
  origin validation (true of all CORS implementations)
- **No credentials support**: This implementation doesn't set 
  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` (cookies/auth headers won't be sent cross-origin).
  Please create an issue in our GitHub project if you would like to see us add
  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` support.
