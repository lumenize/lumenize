description: Choosing the right workflow for new work (docs-first vs implementation-first)

# Workflow Selection

When starting new work, choose the appropriate workflow based on what's being changed.

## Decision Rule

**Ask: "Will this change how a developer uses this package?"**

- ✅ **If YES** → Use `/task-management` with **docs-first workflow**
- ✅ **If NO** → Use `/task-management` with **implementation-first workflow**

## Docs-First (For User-Facing Changes)

**When:**
- Designing new user-facing API
- Adding major features to packages
- Creating new public methods/services
- Changing existing user-facing behavior

**Process:**
1. Use `/task-management` command
2. Draft user-facing documentation first (`website/docs/[package]/[feature].mdx`)
3. Iterate on docs until API is perfect (maintainer reviews/approves)
4. Update task file with implementation phases
5. Implement following the finalized API spec
6. Use `/documentation-workflow` for validation (Phases 2-4)

**Key:** The MDX documentation dominates. Get the API right from the user's perspective before writing any code.

## Implementation-First (For Internal Changes)

**When:**
- Refactoring internal code (no API changes)
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes (preserving API)
- Internal tooling/scripts
- Test infrastructure

**Process:**
1. Use `/task-management` command
2. Create task file with phases and goals
3. Implement changes
4. Update/create documentation after (if needed)

## Reference

- **Task management**: `/task-management` command
- **Documentation workflow**: `/documentation-workflow` command
