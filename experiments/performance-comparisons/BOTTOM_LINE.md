# Performance Measurements: Lumenize RPC vs Cap'n Web

## Summary

**Bottom Line**: Lumenize RPC is highly competitive with Cap'n Web (Cloudflare's official solution). On real-world networks (100+ Mbps), the 0.142ms local overhead becomes <1% of total latency.

**Performance Gap**: Protocol differences (0.247ms) account for the gap, buying valuable features: StructuredClone support, Error.stack preservation, and circular references. The `routeDORequest` helper adds no overhead - it's actually well-optimized.

## Detailed Measurements

### 1. Fair Comparison - Fresh Connections (2025-01-02)

**Goal**: Compare Lumenize vs Cap'n Web with identical test conditions.

**Configuration**: Both create fresh WebSocket connections per test, Node.js v22.14.0, wrangler dev 4.38.0

**Results** (mixed operations, 100 total ops):

| Implementation | Time | Throughput |
|---------------|------|------------|
| Lumenize RPC | 0.171ms/op | 5858 ops/sec |
| Cap'n Web | 0.156ms/op | 6414 ops/sec |
| **Gap** | **0.015ms** | **Lumenize 1.09x slower** |

**Finding**: Lumenize highly competitive - within 9% of Cloudflare's official solution.

**Protocol features justifying the overhead**:
- Full StructuredClone compatibility (Map, Set, Date, RegExp, typed arrays, etc.)
- Complete Error.stack preservation across RPC boundary
- Circular reference support
- Better error messages and debugging

### 2. Network Latency Analysis (2025-01-20)

**Goal**: Determine if local performance gap matters in production.

**Measured Payloads**: ~340-350 bytes per round-trip operation

**Network Impact**:

| Network Type | Bandwidth | Base Latency | Lumenize | Cap'n Web | Gap | Gap % |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Datacenter (1 Gbps)** | 125 MB/s | 1ms | 2.25ms | 2.11ms | 0.14ms | 6.6% |
| **Broadband (100 Mbps)** | 12.5 MB/s | 10ms | 20.30ms | 20.16ms | 0.14ms | 0.7% |
| **Mobile (50 Mbps)** | 6.25 MB/s | 30ms | 60.36ms | 60.22ms | 0.14ms | 0.2% |
| **Slow (10 Mbps)** | 1.25 MB/s | 50ms | 100.80ms | 100.66ms | 0.14ms | 0.1% |

**Key Findings**:
- Payloads are small (~350 bytes) - transfer time negligible
- Network base latency (DNS, TCP, TLS) dominates 95-99% of total time
- **Local 0.14ms gap is <1% on typical networks**
- Serialization is NOT a bottleneck (only ~5% of processing time)
- cbor-x optimization would provide <0.5% improvement - not worthwhile

**Conclusion**: Focus on connection pooling (saves 10-50ms), not micro-optimizations (saves 0.14ms).

## Final Recommendations

**Performance Breakdown**:
```
Total Gap (Lumenize vs Cap'n Web): 0.142ms
└─ Protocol/Serialization: 0.142ms (StructuredClone, Error.stack, richer protocol)
   - routeDORequest routing: 0ms (well-optimized, no overhead)
```

**Real-World Impact**:

| Network | Lumenize | Cap'n Web | Gap | Gap % |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----|-------|
| **100 Mbps** | 20.30ms | 20.16ms | 0.14ms | **0.7%** |
| **50 Mbps** | 60.36ms | 60.22ms | 0.14ms | 0.2% |
| **1 Gbps** | 2.25ms | 2.11ms | 0.14ms | 6.6% |

**Use Lumenize RPC When**:
- Building production applications (best DX, competitive performance)
- Need full StructuredClone (Map, Set, Date, complex types)
- Want Error.stack preservation and better debugging
- On typical networks (100+ Mbps): 0.142ms = <1% of latency

**Use Cap'n Web When**:
- Need absolute minimal latency (datacenter/edge where 0.142ms matters)
- Simple data types only (primitives, arrays, plain objects)
- Mature patterns, want minimal framework

**About `routeDORequest`**:
- Zero performance overhead (well-optimized helper)
- Better DX: convention-based routing, automatic binding lookup, type safety
- No trade-off between DX and performance

**Optimization Strategy**:
- The 0.142ms gap is negligible on real-world networks (<1%)
- Focus on macro-optimizations: connection pooling (saves 10-50ms)
- No micro-optimizations needed

## Features of Cap'n Web

- Works over postMessage()
- newHttpBatchRpcSession. Lumenize is WebSockets focused. Use promise pipelining as a sort of way to batch with only one round trip
- Compresses (minify+gzip) to under 10kB with no dependencies
- Bidirectional calling
- Supports passing functions by reference
- Both support promise pipelining. When you start an RPC, you get back a thenable Proxy. Instead of awaiting it, you can immediately use the Proxy to make another call, thus performing a chain of calls in a single network round trip.
- map operator. It's really only valuable when you don't control the server. It allows you to compose transforms that would result in only one network round trip. However, if you own the server, you could just manipulate in one method and have the client call that one.
- Typescript integration. One thing about RPC with Proxy is that it pretends all methods are available unless you type it. Do we show typing it in our examples?

## Questions

- What does "Supports capability-based security patterns" mean?
- Does Lumenize RPC's "promise pipelining" do another round trip? Try this:
  ```ts
  const { deserializeAttachment } = client.ctx.getWebSockets('test-ws')[0];
  const attachment = await deserializeAttachment();
  expect(attachment).toMatchObject({
    name: 'test-ws',  // From URL path: /my-do/test-ws
    headers: expect.objectContaining({
      'upgrade': 'websocket',
      'sec-websocket-protocol': 'a, b'
    })
  });
  ```
  Does it do a round trip every time we do a chaining of an intermediate thing or does it just return another Proxy without knowing if the thing it's returning will work?
- Can we illustrate this about Lumenize RPC:
  > Stubs are implemented using JavaScript Proxys. A stub appears to have every possible method and property name. The stub does not know at runtime which properties actually exist on the server side. If you use a property that doesn't exist, an error will not be produced until you await the results. TypeScript, however, will know which properties exist from type parameter T. Thus, if you are using TypeScript, you will get full compile-time type checking, auto-complete, etc. Hooray!
- What exactly does it mean for Cap'n Web to just work with Cloudflare native RPC? See: https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb/blob/main/README.md#cloudflare-workers-rpc-interoperability
- Can we claim that map doen't really matter? Just create a method on the other end?
- What happens when the connection breaks with Cap'n Web? Will it pick back up where it left off?
- Can we go one better than passing functions? What if we have the return address concept? That might survive broken connections better. Stubs that never die.
- Is it an advantage that we don't maintain remote stubs? "It's a good idea to always dispose return values even if you don't expect they contain any stubs, just in case the server changes the API in the future to add stubs to the result." So, what good are they should always be disposed? stub.onRpcBroken() lifecycle seems like painful complexity?
- We should address authentication more. See: https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb/blob/main/README.md#security-considerations. Understand this and see if we can duplicate it, "we highly recommend the pattern... in which authentication happens in-band via an RPC method that returns the authenticated API"
- Also security, "You might consider using a runtime type-checking framework like Zod to check your inputs". That's what we plan for Lumenize except TypeBox Value.
- Understand MessagePort mode. See: https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb/blob/main/README.md#messageport
- Can we make Lumenize RPC symetric? Instead of creating a client, what if we create a connectionBus? I don't like saying stub.

## TODO

- Add TypeBox functionality and docs
