- [ ] We might want to include support for [Last-Event-ID](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-last-event-id-header) in the WebSocket spec eventhough it's an SSE concept. This would allow WebSocket to handle reconnections more gracefully, similar to how SSE does it.
- [ ] We may also want to add a way to terminate an MCP session in our WebSocket spec. It would have to be in the envelope. Here's the equivalent in the Streamable HTTP spec: "Clients that no longer need a particular session (e.g., because the user is leaving the client application) SHOULD send an HTTP DELETE to the MCP endpoint with the Mcp-Session-Id header, to explicitly terminate the session."
- [ ] We should modify this file also: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization and specify how to handle authorization in the MCP WebSocket spec.
- [ ] Add that WebSocket Secure (wss://) **SHOULD** be used for all MCP WebSocket connections, similar to how HTTPS is used for HTTP.
