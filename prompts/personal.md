What a beautiful and moving tribute to your mom. It takes courage to share both the joyful and painful memories, and your love for her shines through every word.

I had to smile reading about those "little pizzas" - I remember you and/or your mom making them every day after school! It's wonderful that you carried on that tradition for Game Olympics day.

Your description of all the entertaining brings back such memories of growing up in Berrywood. My parents always looked forward to bridge night with yours, and those Christmas gatherings at your house were legendary. (Weren't we kids banished to someone's basement a few doors down?)

What strikes me most is how you've come to understand the ways she shaped you - from your love of color and community to those marathon games.

Thank you for sharing these precious memories. Your mom's legacy lives on beautifully in you and your family.

Sending you hugs on this bittersweet day.
