# Nebula — Architecture Reference

**License**: UNLICENSED (until external launch)
**Primary App**: `apps/nebula/` in the Lumenize monorepo (not published to npm)
**Auth Package**: `@lumenize/nebula-auth` (separate package in `packages/`, `"private": true`)
**Built on**: `@lumenize/mesh` (MIT) — extends its classes (including `LumenizeClientGateway` via the mesh-extensibility hooks)

## What Nebula Is — Walled Garden, Not a Toolkit

Lumenize Nebula is a SaaS vibe coding deployment product built on Lumenize Mesh.

Lumenize Mesh is a flexible open-source toolkit: developers extend LumenizeDO, wire up their own routing, swap in their own auth, choose their own UI framework. Nebula is the opposite — it's a **product, not a toolkit**. The user-developer never touches the back end. They provide an ontology (data model) and Nebula does everything else: auth, routing, storage, real-time sync, access control. On the client side, they use NebulaClient plus the Vue-based `@lumenize/nebula/frontend` factory (Vue 3 under the hood) — no React, no Svelte, no choice. User-provided server-side logic (guards, migrations, validation) runs in sandboxed Cloudflare Dynamic Worker Loader (DWL) isolates or Cloudflare Containers sandbox. Data extraction integrations get clear REST endpoints but nothing more.

**This matters for design decisions.** When writing Nebula task files, don't offer escape hatches, configuration alternatives, or "the developer can do X instead." If there's one right way, that's the only way. Guard against footguns by removing the footgun, not by documenting it.

**Extends, not forks.** All Nebula classes extend their Lumenize Mesh counterparts: `NebulaDO extends LumenizeDO`, `NebulaClient extends LumenizeClient`, `NebulaClientGateway extends LumenizeClientGateway`. The Gateway extension is enabled by the mesh-extensibility hooks (instance name validation, claims extraction, callContext enrichment, inbound envelope validation). No forking needed.

**Auth**: `@lumenize/nebula-auth` is a separate package (`"private": true`). It exports `routeNebulaAuthRequest` for the entrypoint to compose into its routing. Everything else new goes into `apps/nebula/`.

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **App structure** | `apps/nebula/` for the deployable app, `packages/nebula-auth/` (`private: true`) for auth library | Apps aren't published; auth is a library consumed by the app |
| **NebulaDO** | Base class extends `LumenizeDO`; `Universe`, `Galaxy`, `Star` extend `NebulaDO` | `onBeforeCall` reserved for base class (universeGalaxyStarId binding); subclasses use `@mesh(guard)` |
| **NebulaClientGateway** | Extends `LumenizeClientGateway` (via the mesh-extensibility hooks) | Overrides `onBeforeCallToClient` for active-scope verification; reads active scope from JWT `aud` claim |
| **NebulaClient** | Extends `LumenizeClient` | Gets WebSocket management, token refresh, tab detection, Browser injection for testing |
| **Access control** | Four layers: entrypoint `verifyNebulaAccessToken` → Gateway `onBeforeCallToClient` active-scope check → `onBeforeCall` scope binding → `@mesh(guard)` | Entrypoint rejects early; Gateway verifies mesh→client scope match; base class locks DO to active scope (also admits when an **admin** caller's `authScopePattern` covers the target — shipped via the shared `enforceScopeReach` guard; see `tasks/archive/nebula-onbeforecall-higher-admin-reach.md`); guards handle method-level auth |
| **DAG permissions** | Grant if any ancestor path grants | Simple model: admin > write > read. Roll-down through tree. |
| **DWL architecture** | Inverted — DO calls OUT to DWL | DWL is callback provider. DO owns storage, subscriptions, fanout. |
| **`transaction()` API** | Mixed upserts/deletes, single-phase pessimistic eTag check inside `transactionSync` | Minimizes DWL round-trips (billing), ensures atomicity despite input gate opening |
| **Schema** | TypeScript types, not DSL | No Zod, TypeBox, or JSON Schema. `.d.ts` is the source of truth (ADR-001). |
| **Resource history** | R2 (`<resourceId>/<validFrom>`), not per-resource DOs | Unbounded growth moves off Star SQLite; Star keeps eTag metadata (ADR-004; mechanics `tasks/on-hold/nebula-resource-history-r2.md`) |
| **Testing** | E2e strongly favored, Browser.fetch/WebSocket injection | Dogfood `@lumenize/testing`; integration tests are primary |
