/**
 * DevStar — the Studio sandbox Star, addressed by the reserved 3rd-segment
 * slug `dev` (e.g. instanceName = "acme.app.dev").
 *
 * It **inherits everything a Star has** — its own SQLite, DAG tree,
 * subscriptions, per-Star permissions, the Fix-1 structural scope-isolation
 * `onBeforeCall`, and the Galaxy-admin access bypass — and adds a contained
 * layer of **dev-only** behavior (eager version application + breaking-edit
 * data reset). That behavior lives here, on the subclass, NOT behind a runtime
 * flag on `Star`: a tenant Star must not be able to carry a data-wiping reset,
 * so it must not exist there at all.
 *
 * Addressing is slug-derived (§ Naming & binding selection in
 * tasks/dev-star.md): a caller at `{u}.{g}.dev` targets the `DEV_STAR` binding;
 * any other star slug targets `STAR`. The bare 3-tuple name flows through
 * Fix-1's `buildAuthScopePattern → matchAccess` exactly like any Star, so no
 * scope-isolation-side wiring is needed.

   * gate — the **first statement**, no awaited work before it — closes before
   * the first `await`. `deleteAll()` is the sanctioned async-storage exception
   * (no sync variant); it wipes the **entire** private SQLite DB (SQL tables +
   * KV + alarm rows) in one call, so nothing *stored* is stranded. `this.onStart()`
   * then reconstructs the helper objects (fresh empty caches) and recreates
   * schema + ROOT for free (the helper constructors are idempotent — no separate
   * init helper), and nulls `#row`/`#facet`. The DO instance + `{u}.{g}.dev`

   * admin call's `onBeforeCall` first-touch (the `deleteAll` wiped the
   * `__nebula_rootAdminSeeded` latch), leaving ROOT briefly grantless. Acceptable:
   * dev users reach the sandbox via the `claims.access.admin` bypass regardless,
   * and the triggering admin's own next call reseeds.
   *
   * ⚠️ **Precondition (caller's responsibility, not enforced here):** the dev
   * Star also holds the user-developer's *source* (ontology + UI `file`
   * resources) as a disposable working copy, which `deleteAll` wipes too. This is
   * "data-only" reset ONLY because the source is durably owned by the Galaxy —
   * do not wire a live trigger until source-durability on Galaxy holds (owned by
   * tasks/nebula-studio.md § Durable draft ownership), or a breaking edit
   * destroys the user's work.
