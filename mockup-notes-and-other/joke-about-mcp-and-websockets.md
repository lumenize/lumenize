stdio, HTTP, and SSE walk into The Model Context Protocol (#MCP) Bar.

The bartender immediately puts three different drinks in front of them.

"What's this?" asks stdio.

"That guy at the end of the bar sent them over. Yours is called a 'Local Buffer Brew' - it's non-alcoholic and comes with training wheels," replies the bartender.

"I can't drink this," says stdio, "I'm a simple man. I can only drink local brews. HTTP, what's yours?"

HTTP looks at the label on his bottle and says, "Mine's a 'Fire-and-Forget Fizz.' It's refreshing, but there's a warning: 'May cause complete memory loss after each sip. Not suitable for ongoing conversations.'"

HTTP then lost the thread of the conversation and started into space. So, stdio chimes in, "Hey Bartender, what's SSE drinking?"

The bartender smiles and says, "He's enjoying a 'One-Way Stream Supreme.' It keeps the conversation flowing smoothly, but there's a catch - once he starts singing, he can't stop, and you can't sing back. Also, for some reason, he can only sing that old cat food jingle now."

SSE smashes his drink in protest but can't stop singing "Meow-meow-meow-meow, meow-meow-meow-meow..."

Just before SSE storms out, a lady at the other end of the bar says, "Hey, SSE, let's form a musical trio with HTTP. HTTP can handle the requests. I'll be his memory and change the playlist so you can sing about something other than cats. We can call ourselves the Streamable HTTP band!"

Finally, the guy at the end of the bar, who sent the drinks, stands up and says, "Or... hear me out... I'm WebSocket. I can handle the full conversation, remember everything, let you all talk back and forth, AND I don't randomly start singing about cats. Think of me as the bartender who never forgets your order and can serve every desire all by myself."

stdio, HTTP, and SSE all turn to look at each other, then back at WebSocket.

"So you're saying," stdio asks slowly, "that I can handle local needs AND you can do all my talking on the wire? No more dealing with HTTP headers or SSL handshakes?"

"And you won't forget me after every interaction?" HTTP adds hopefully.

SSE tries to say something but can only manage a questioning "meow-meow-meow?"

WebSocket grins, "Exactly. I'm like having a direct phone line instead of sending postcards, forgetting who you are, or being stuck in a one-sided karaoke session about felines."

The three of them abandon their drinks and walk over to WebSocket. "Welcome to the future of MCP," WebSocket says, "where the transport actually transports, and the protocol actually protocols."

"Wait," stdio asks, "what's your drink called?"

WebSocket grins and raises his glass, "Full-Duplex Delight - it goes both ways and never gets stale."
